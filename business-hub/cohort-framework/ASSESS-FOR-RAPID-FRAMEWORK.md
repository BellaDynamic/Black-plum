# ASSESS for RAPID - Cohort Compliance Framework

**Organizational Management System for Cohort Coordination**  
**Created by: Brandy Bianchini**  
**Purpose: Mandatory compliance pathway for all cohort members before external engagement**

---

## Framework Overview

The **ASSESS for RAPID** framework is the foundational compliance system that ensures all cohort members understand, align with, and properly execute within the organizational methodologies, protocols, and systems established by Brandy Bianchini. This framework serves as the living, breathing organizational management footprint for coordinating transactions, activities, events, and external communications.

**Core Principle:** No cohort member may engage in external conversations about enterprise ideas or intellectual property until they have completed the ASSESS for RAPID pathway and have prepared documentation, offering structures, and communication protocols approved through this system.

---

## Phase Structure Overview

The ASSESS for RAPID framework consists of five sequential assessment phases, each building upon the previous to ensure comprehensive understanding and compliance:

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Certification Required |
|-------|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Assess/Pre-Gab | Initial idea evaluation and gap analysis | No |
| **Phase 2** | Assess/Gab | Formal presentation and alignment discussion | No |
| **Phase 3** | Assess/Pre-Rapid | Rapid Phase Plan preparation and systems integration | No |
| **Phase 4** | Assess/Rapid | Full RAPID methodology application and documentation | Yes |
| **Phase 5** | Assess/RF-FS | Financial structuring and sustainability planning | Yes |
