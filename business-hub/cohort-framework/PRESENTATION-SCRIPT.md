---

**Speaker Note:** *Pause for a moment to let the title sink in. Convey a sense of urgency and importance.*

### SLIDE 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW

**(Click to Slide 2)**

**Presenter:** "So, what exactly is Street Legends?"

**Presenter:** "It’s a travel docu-series designed to capture the authentic, vibrant culture of automotive events across America. We’ll be embedding ourselves in the world of high-octane drag racing with the **NHRA**, capturing the spectacle of **NASCAR** and its incredible fan base, and bringing a unique entertainment element to each location with the **Super Circus**."

**Presenter:** "This entire ecosystem will be supported by our **Auto Industry Sponsors**—the brands and businesses that are the lifeblood of the automotive world."

**Presenter:** "The vision here is simple but powerful: to create compelling, reality-based content by filming **live events** with **real people**, driven by **real passion**, and telling their **real stories**."

---

### SLIDE 3: WHY EVENT-FIRST MATTERS

**(Click to Slide 3)**

**Presenter:** "To do this, we are flipping the traditional production model on its head."

**Presenter:** "Normally, you’d start with a script, then cast your actors, find a location, and then film. It’s a linear, controlled process."

**Presenter:** "The Street Legends model is different. We start with **Events First**. That means we lock down our venues, our dates, and our contracts *before* we even think about rolling a camera. Once the events are secured, our **Event Crew** runs the show on the ground. While that’s happening, our **Z Crew**—the content capture team—films everything in the background, documentary-style. Only then, with real footage in hand, does Jimmy’s producer vision shape the **script** and the final series."

**Presenter:** "Why does this work? Because it gives us **authentic, unscripted content**. It dramatically **lowers production costs** since we aren’t building sets or staging scenes. It provides a **built-in audience** as event attendees become our first fans. And it creates immediate **revenue opportunities** through tickets, concessions, and merchandise."

---

### SLIDE 4: THE 30-DAY CHALLENGE

**(Click to Slide 4)**

**Presenter:** "Which brings us to the 30-Day Challenge."

**Presenter:** "Our mission is to secure all foundational contracts to green-light this production by **March 1, 2026**."

**Presenter:** "Right now, we have over 50 stakeholders who have shown interest, but we have **no formal agreements in place**. This is the critical problem we need to solve."

**Presenter:** "Without contracts, we can’t apply for state and local economic development funds. We can’t secure insurance or permits. We can’t commit to production schedules. In short, we can’t move forward with the confidence and security this project demands."

**Presenter:** "The solution is a structured, 30-day assessment phase designed to align all parties and, most importantly, execute all agreements."

---

### SLIDE 5: PHASE 0 - ASSESS/PRE-EVENT

**(Click to Slide 5)**

**Presenter:** "To achieve this, we’ve introduced a new phase into our operational framework: **Phase 0: Assess/Pre-Event**."

**Presenter:** "This is a new, mandatory step in our ASSESS for RAPID framework, specifically designed for event-driven projects like Street Legends."

**Presenter:** "Its purpose is singular: to secure all external dependencies required to make the events—and therefore, the production—viable."

**Presenter:** "This phase will run for the next 30 days, from February 1st to March 1st. Key activities will include stakeholder onboarding to our Align platform, conducting discovery calls, distributing and negotiating contracts, and finally, collecting signatures and initial capital contributions."

---

### SLIDE 6: THE 4-WEEK BREAKDOWN

**(Click to Slide 6)**

**Presenter:** "Here’s how we’ll break down the next 30 days."

**Presenter:** "**Week 1**, which is this week, is all about **Stakeholder Alignment and Onboarding**. I’ll be importing all 50+ contacts into Align, sending out a ‘Reality Check’ message to set expectations, and scheduling discovery calls with our top 10 most critical stakeholders."

**Presenter:** "**Week 2** is for **Contract Distribution and Negotiation**. We’ll send out all five of our contract templates and begin negotiating terms with the Super Circus, our venues, and our sponsors."

**Presenter:** "**Week 3** is focused on **Finalizing Agreements and Securing Commitments**. This is where we’ll finalize all contract terms and get verbal commitments from all parties."

**Presenter:** "And **Week 4** is for **Execution**. We’ll be obtaining all signatures, collecting initial capital contributions, and submitting our state and local funding requests."

**Speaker Note:** *Speak with a clear, confident pace. This is the core of the action plan.* 

---

### SLIDE 7: KEY STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES

**(Click to Slide 7)**

**Presenter:** "These are the seven key stakeholder categories we are focused on during this 30-day period. Each one requires a specific type of agreement and a clear understanding of their role."

**Presenter:** "We have our **NHRA** and **NASCAR** events, which require venue contracts and filming permissions. We have the **Super Circus**, which needs a master service agreement for its state-by-state operations. We have our **Auto Industry Sponsors**, who will be signing contribution agreements. And of course, we have our **Event Crew** and our **Z Crew**, who will be operating under service agreements. Finally, we have the **Venues** themselves, which require specific agreements for access and insurance."

---

### SLIDE 8: CONTRACT TEMPLATES

**(Click to Slide 8)**

**Presenter:** "To streamline this process, we have developed **five standardized contract templates**."

**Presenter:** "We have a **Sponsor/Contributor Agreement**, a **Venue Agreement**, a **Super Circus Master Service Agreement**, an **Event Crew Service Agreement**, and a **Z Crew Service Agreement**."

**Presenter:** "These templates will ensure consistency, protect our interests, and accelerate the negotiation process. All of these are available for review in our cohort framework documentation."

---

### SLIDE 9: ALIGN PLATFORM INTEGRATION

**(Click to Slide 9)**

**Presenter:** "So, why are we using Align for this?"

**Presenter:** "Align will be our centralized communication and project management platform for Street Legends. It will eliminate scattered emails and ensure we have a single source of truth for all documentation, communication, and task management. It also integrates with our digital signature tools, allowing us to execute contracts efficiently."

**Presenter:** "We’ll have a **Master Project Room** for all key stakeholders, **Private Rooms** for one-on-one conversations, and **Group Rooms** for focused discussions with specific stakeholder categories."

---

### SLIDE 10: SUCCESS CRITERIA

**(Click to Slide 10)**

**Presenter:** "This is what success looks like on March 1st."

**Presenter:** "By March 1, 2026, we must have all 50+ stakeholders onboarded to Align. We must have a Master Alignment Agreement executed with all key parties. The Super Circus operations must be defined and contracted. All venue, crew, and sponsor agreements must be signed. Initial capital must be collected. And our state and local funding requests must be submitted."

**Presenter:** "If we achieve all of this, the project will be officially **GREEN-LIT** for production planning."

**Speaker Note:** *Emphasize the "GREEN-LIT" status. This is the ultimate goal of the 30-day plan.* 

---

### SLIDE 11: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MARCH 1?

**(Click to Slide 11)**

**Presenter:** "So, what happens after March 1st?"

**Presenter:** "If we are successful, we will immediately enter **Phase 1: Assess/Pre-GRID**, where we will begin our formal RAPID assessment. We’ll develop a detailed production schedule, finalize our state-by-state logistics, and begin pre-production activities."

**Presenter:** "If we are unsuccessful, the contingency clauses in our contracts will activate, contributions will be returned, and we will need to re-assess the project’s viability and determine alternative pathways."

---

### SLIDE 12: YOUR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS

**(Click to Slide 12)**

**Presenter:** "This is a team effort, and everyone has a critical role to play."

**Presenter:** "As the Executive Producer and Organizational Manager, **I (Brandy Bianchini)** will be leading all stakeholder communications, managing contract negotiations, and ensuring compliance with our framework."

**Presenter:** "**Jimmy McNickle**, as the Producer and Creator, will maintain relationships with our key stakeholders, provide the creative vision, and support contract negotiations."

**Presenter:** "And as **Cohort Members**, we are asking you to provide feedback and support, review contracts and processes, and offer your expertise in legal, finance, and logistics."

---

### SLIDE 13: TOOLS & RESOURCES

**(Click to Slide 13)**

**Presenter:** "We have a full suite of tools and resources to support this effort."

**Presenter:** "Our documentation includes the Street Legends Project Template, the 30-Day Action Plan Tracker, our Stakeholder Alignment System, the Align Room Setup Guide, and all five contract templates."

**Presenter:** "For tracking, we will be using the Excel spreadsheet, which includes weekly task lists, a stakeholder database, and a contract status tracker. All of these resources are available in our cohort framework repository."

---

### SLIDE 14: QUESTIONS & DISCUSSION

**(Click to Slide 14)**

**Presenter:** "Now, I’d like to open it up for questions and discussion."

**Presenter:** "I want us to consider a few key questions: Are there any missing stakeholder categories? Do our contract templates cover all necessary scenarios? What are the biggest risks to completing this in 30 days? How can we best support each other during this phase? And what happens if key stakeholders don’t commit?"

**Speaker Note:** *Facilitate a 10-15 minute discussion. Encourage open and honest feedback.* 

---

### SLIDE 15: NEXT STEPS

**(Click to Slide 15)**

**Presenter:** "Alright, let’s talk about immediate next steps for this week."

**Presenter:** "My top priority is to import all contacts into Align and send the Reality Check message. I will also be scheduling discovery calls with the Super Circus, NHRA, and NASCAR."

**Presenter:** "Jimmy, I’ll need you to review the contract templates and provide your feedback."

**Presenter:** "And for the rest of the cohort, please review all the documentation and provide your input. Our next cohort meeting will be on February 14th, at the end of Week 2, where we will review our progress."

### SLIDE 16: CLOSING

**(Click to Slide 16)**

**Presenter:** "I want to close with our guiding principle for this project: **‘Events First, Then Production.’**"

**Presenter:** "Thank you for your time and your commitment. Let’s make this happen."
