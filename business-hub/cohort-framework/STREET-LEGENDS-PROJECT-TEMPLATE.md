# Street Legends Project: Event-First Framework & 30-Day Action Plan

**Author:** Brandy Bianchini  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Purpose:** Hard asset for managing the Street Legends travel docu-series, ensuring all events, contracts, and logistics are secured **before** production begins.

---

## 1. The Mandate: Events First, Then Production

The Street Legends project is a **reality-based travel docu-series**. The content is generated from real-world events. Therefore, the production process cannot begin until all events are fully contracted, scheduled, and logistically secured. The core principle is:

> We cannot script, shoot, or produce what has not yet happened or been contractually guaranteed to happen.

This framework ensures that all foundational event and stakeholder agreements are in place **before** the project enters the standard RAPID assessment and production lifecycle.

## 2. The Current Situation: Acknowledgment & Correction

We acknowledge that preliminary communications have been sent to numerous potential stakeholders. Our immediate priority is to formalize these relationships and provide a **"reality check"** on the project's actual status, timeline, and requirements. All stakeholders must be brought into the **Align** system for transparent, centralized communication.

## 3. The 30-Day Action Plan: February 1 - March 1

This aggressive 30-day plan is designed to secure all necessary commitments and contracts to make the Street Legends series a reality.

| Week | Dates | Key Objective | Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Feb 1-7 | **Stakeholder Alignment & Onboarding** | 1. Import all 50+ contacts into the **Align** system. <br> 2. Send a standardized "Project Reality Check" message via Align. <br> 3. Schedule initial discovery calls with high-priority stakeholders (venues, sponsors, Super Circus). <br> 4. Draft initial contract templates. |
| **2** | Feb 8-14 | **Contract Distribution & Negotiation** | 1. Distribute draft contracts to all key parties: Venues, Super Circus, NHRA, NASCAR, Auto Industry Sponsors. <br> 2. Begin negotiations on terms, dates, and contributions. <br> 3. Define clear load-in/load-out times, locations, and concession terms for the Super Circus (state-by-state). |
| **3** | Feb 15-21 | **Finalize Agreements & Secure Commitments** | 1. Finalize all contract terms. <br> 2. Secure verbal and written commitments for contributions (time, money, assets). <br> 3. Create **Right of Use Agreements** for all capital contributors, linking funds directly to the project. <br> 4. Lock down filming permissions with all venues. |
| **4** | Feb 22-28 | **Execute Contracts & Prepare for State Funding** | 1. Obtain all required signatures on all contracts. <br> 2. Collect initial capital contributions. <br> 3. Package all signed contracts into a **Master Alignment Agreement**. <br> 4. Prepare formal requests for state/local capital (Economic Development, Tourism Funds). |

**Goal by March 1st:** All foundational event and stakeholder contracts are executed, and the project is green-lit for production planning.

## 4. The New Framework: Phase 0: Assess/Pre-Event

For event-driven productions like Street Legends, a new preliminary phase is required. This phase precedes the standard ASSESS for RAPID framework.

### Phase 0: Assess/Pre-Event (The Foundation)

*   **Purpose:** To secure all external dependencies required to make the event (and thus, the production) viable.
*   **Duration:** 30 Days (aligned with the action plan).
*   **Exit Criteria:** Fully executed Master Alignment Agreement with all key stakeholders.

#### Key Activities in Phase 0:

1.  **Stakeholder Contracting:**
    *   Formalize relationships with all sponsors and contributors identified on the pink sticky notes (NHRA, Circus, NASCAR, Auto Industry).
    *   Execute Right of Use agreements for all financial contributions.

2.  **Venue Contracting:**
    *   Secure hard contracts with every venue for specific dates.
    *   Contracts must include explicit permission for the **Z Crew** to film on-site during the events.

3.  **Service Provider Contracting:**
    *   **Super Circus:** A master state-by-state contract defining their entire operation (setup, teardown, concessions, revenue share, etc.). This is a **constant** around which other logistics are built.
    *   **Event Crew:** Contracts for the team responsible for running the physical events.
    *   **Z Crew:** Contracts for the content capture team.

4.  **Logistics & Deconfliction:**
    *   Map out all event dates and locations.
    *   Identify and resolve any direct conflicts (e.g., a NASCAR event and a Hot Rod event at the same venue in the same timeframe).

5.  **State-by-State Initiative Packaging:**
    *   Bundle the secured contracts and event plans for each state.
    *   This package becomes the basis for formal procurement requests to state and local government entities for funding.

## 5. The Production Sequence (Post-Phase 0)

Once Phase 0 is complete and all event contracts are secured, the project can proceed into the standard operational framework.

1.  **Enter ASSESS for RAPID Framework:** With events confirmed, a realistic RAPID assessment can now begin. The "unknowns" have been made "knowns."

2.  **Execute Live Events (Event Crew):** The contracted Event Crew runs the live events as scheduled.

3.  **Capture Content (Z Crew):** The Z Crew operates in the background, capturing the drama, talent, and action as it unfolds. This includes capturing footage of the **$50,000 merchandise brand** for the Better World campaign.

4.  **Producer's Vision to Script:** The raw footage and captured stories are given to the producer (Jimmy). This content forms the basis of the script and the narrative for the docu-series.

5.  **Post-Production & Delivery:** The scripted series is edited and prepared for delivery based on the practicum and shot lists discussed.

This sequence ensures that the production budget is spent on a guaranteed foundation of events, not on speculative plans.

## 6. GRID Integration & Campaign Management

*   **GRID:** The Street Legends project will occupy a primary cell in the GRID, with sub-cells dedicated to each major event (NASCAR, NHRA, Circus) and state initiative.
*   **Better World:** The merchandise and brand promotion component, including the $50,000 brand-up, will be managed and tracked through a dedicated campaign on the **Better World** platform.

This template serves as the single source of truth for the Street Legends project, ensuring a logical, sequential, and contractually sound approach to execution.
