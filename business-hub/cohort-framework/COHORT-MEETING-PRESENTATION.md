## SLIDE 1: TITLE

**Street Legends: 30-Day Action Plan**

*Event-First Production Strategy*

February 1 - March 1, 2026

---

## SLIDE 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What is Street Legends?**

A travel docu-series capturing the authentic culture of automotive events across America, featuring:

- **NHRA Events** - High-octane drag racing and automotive culture
- **NASCAR Events** - Stock car racing and fan experiences
- **Super Circus** - A traveling spectacle bringing entertainment to each location
- **Auto Industry Sponsors** - Brands and businesses that fuel the automotive world

**The Vision:** Create compelling, reality-based content by filming live events with real people, real passion, and real stories.

---

## SLIDE 3: WHY EVENT-FIRST MATTERS

**Traditional Production Model:**
1. Script → 2. Cast → 3. Location → 4. Film

**Street Legends Model:**
1. **Events First** (Lock venues, dates, contracts)
2. **Execute Events** (Event Crew runs the show)
3. **Capture Content** (Z Crew films in background)
4. **Producer Vision → Script** (Jimmy uses footage to create series)

**Why This Works:**
- Authentic, unscripted content
- Lower production costs (no sets, no staged scenes)
- Built-in audience (event attendees become fans)
- Revenue opportunities (ticket sales, concessions, merchandise)

---

## SLIDE 4: THE 30-DAY CHALLENGE

**Mission:** Secure all foundational contracts to green-light production by March 1, 2026.

**Current Status:** 50+ stakeholders identified, but no formal agreements in place.

**The Problem:** Without contracts, we cannot:
- Apply for state/local economic development funds
- Secure insurance and permits
- Commit to production schedules
- Move forward with confidence

**The Solution:** A structured, 30-day assessment phase to align all parties and execute all agreements.
