## Framework Structure

### The ASSESS for RAPID Five-Phase Framework

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Duration | Certification |
|-------|------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **0** | **Assess/Pre-Event** | **NEW:** Event-driven projects only - secure all external dependencies | 30 days | No |
| **1** | **Assess/Pre-Gab** | Initial evaluation and gap analysis | 1-2 weeks | No |
| **2** | **Assess/Gab** | Cohort presentation and alignment | 2-4 weeks | No |
| **3** | **Assess/Pre-Rapid** | RAPID methodology preparation | 3-6 weeks | No |
| **4** | **Assess/Rapid** | Full RAPID application | 6-12 weeks | **Yes** |
| **5** | **Assess/RF-FS** | Financial structuring (RFFS) | 4-8 weeks | **Yes** |

**Note:** Phase 0 (Assess/Pre-Event) is required only for event-driven productions where external events must be secured before production planning can begin.

---

## NEW: Event-First Methodology

For projects like the **Street Legends travel docu-series**, where content is captured from real-world events, a new preliminary phase has been added:

### Phase 0: Assess/Pre-Event

**Purpose:** Secure all foundational event and stakeholder contracts **before** entering the standard RAPID assessment.

**Key Activities:**
- Contract all venues with filming permissions
- Execute service agreements with event crews and content capture teams
- Formalize sponsor and contributor agreements
- Create Master Alignment Agreement (MAA)
- Prepare state-by-state funding requests

**Exit Criteria:** Fully executed Master Alignment Agreement with all key stakeholders.

**Why This Matters:** You cannot script, shoot, or produce what hasn't been contractually guaranteed to happen. Events first, then production.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Internal Alignment Before External Action
No external conversations about enterprise ideas until Phase 4 certification is received (or Phase 0 completion for event-driven projects).

### 2. Systematic Process Adherence
All projects must use approved organizational tools and software systems.

### 3. Compassionate Engagement
Lead with questions, not assumptions; allow situations to unfurl naturally.

### 4. Commitment to Sustainability
Every project must have viable long-term financial and operational plans.

### 5. **NEW: Events First, Then Production**
For event-driven content, all events must be contracted and secured before production planning begins.
