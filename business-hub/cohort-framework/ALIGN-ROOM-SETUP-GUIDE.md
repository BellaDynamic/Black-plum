**Subject: An Important Update on the "Street Legends" Project**

> Hi [First Name],
> 
> My name is Brandy Bianchini, and I am the executive producer and organizational manager for the "Street Legends" project. I'm reaching out to formally introduce our structured process for moving forward.
> 
> As you know, there has been a great deal of excitement and many conversations about this project. To ensure we proceed in a coordinated and professional manner, we are now entering a formal **30-day pre-event assessment phase** (from February 1 to March 1, 2026).
> 
> **The goal of this phase is simple: to get all foundational contracts and agreements in place so we can officially green-light production.**
> 
> This is our "reality check" moment—a chance to align all parties on a clear, documented path forward. Your involvement is critical, and we want to ensure your role is clearly defined and contractually secured.
> 
> I will be scheduling brief discovery calls with each of you over the next week to discuss your specific role, answer your questions, and outline the next steps for our formal agreement.
> 
> All future communication and document sharing will be managed through this platform to ensure clarity and transparency.
> 
> Thank you for your patience and your passion for this project. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
> 
> Best,
> 
> Brandy Bianchini

    4.  All other stakeholders

### Step 4: Manage Contracts
