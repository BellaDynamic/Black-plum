## Critical Path Management

### Identifying the Critical Path

For each project, the critical path represents the sequence of phases and milestones that must be completed on time to avoid delaying the overall project launch or execution.

**Critical Path Elements:**
1. **Certification Milestones:** Phase 4 and Phase 5 certifications are always on critical path
2. **External Dependencies:** Any milestone dependent on external parties (investors, partners, regulators)
3. **Resource Constraints:** Milestones limited by availability of key resources or people
4. **Sequential Dependencies:** Phases that cannot begin until previous phase is complete

### Managing Critical Path Risks

**Proactive Monitoring:**
- Weekly review of critical path milestone status
- Early identification of potential delays
- Immediate escalation of at-risk milestones

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Build buffer time into critical path milestones
- Identify alternative approaches or parallel paths where possible
- Prioritize resources to critical path activities
- Maintain open communication with all stakeholders on critical path
