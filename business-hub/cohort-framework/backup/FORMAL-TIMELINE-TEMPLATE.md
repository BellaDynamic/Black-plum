# Formal Timeline Template: Per Asset, Per Project, Per Program

**Author:** Brandy Bianchini  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Purpose:** Hard asset for tracking operational phases and GRID integration

---

## Overview

This formal timeline template serves as a **hard asset** for managing each project, program, or asset through the complete ASSESS for RAPID framework. Every timeline is integrated into the **GRID (Global Responsible Integrated Development Tool)** to provide organizational visibility and coordination across all cohort activities.

## Timeline Structure: Year-to-Year Operational Phases

### Phase Breakdown Per Asset/Project/Program

Each asset, project, or program follows this standardized timeline structure, which maps directly into GRID cells for tracking and coordination.

| Phase | Duration | Behind-the-Scenes Activities | GRID Status | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Discernment** | 1-4 weeks | Research, informal conversations, self-assessment | Pre-GRID | Decision to proceed |
| **Assess/Pre-Gab** | 1-2 weeks | Gap analysis, resource identification, vision alignment | GRID Cell Reserved | Initial presentation, gap report |
| **Assess/Gab** | 2-4 weeks | Cohort presentation, feedback integration, IP strategy | GRID Cell Active | Formal presentation, systems map |
| **Assess/Pre-Rapid** | 3-6 weeks | RAPID training, project structuring, resource planning | GRID Cell Active | Preliminary RAPID plan |
| **Assess/Rapid** | 6-12 weeks | Full RAPID application (R-A-P-I-D phases) | GRID Cell Active | Complete RAPID plan, certification |
| **Assess/RF-FS** | 4-8 weeks | Financial modeling, funding strategy, service agreements | GRID Cell Active | Financial model, legal docs, certification |
| **Pre-Launch** | 2-4 weeks | Final prep, stakeholder outreach, systems testing | GRID Cell Launch Ready | Launch materials, team onboarding |
| **Planned Phase** | Ongoing | Active execution, quarterly reviews, optimization | GRID Cell Executing | Quarterly reports, annual reviews |

**Total Timeline from Discernment to Launch:** 19-40 weeks (approximately 5-10 months)

## GRID Integration Map

### How Timelines Fit into GRID Cells

The GRID is structured with a minimum of 16 cells per state, with uncapped squares available for projects, events, activities, brands, or businesses. Each timeline occupies one or more GRID cells depending on scope and complexity.

## Timeline as a Living Document

This timeline template is not static. It is a **living document** that evolves with each project, program, and asset. As cohort members progress through phases, the timeline is updated in real-time within the GRID system, providing organizational visibility and enabling proactive support and coordination.

### Update Frequency

- **Weekly:** Status updates during active Assessment and Planned phases
- **Monthly:** Comprehensive progress reports with milestone tracking
- **Quarterly:** Strategic reviews and timeline adjustments
- **Annually:** Full timeline review and Year 2+ strategic planning

---

## Conclusion

This formal timeline template provides the structure and transparency necessary to manage complex, multi-phase projects across the cohort. By integrating timelines into the GRID system and documenting behind-the-scenes activities, we create a comprehensive organizational management footprint that ensures accountability, supports collaboration, and drives success.

**This is your hard asset. Use it. Update it. Live it.**
