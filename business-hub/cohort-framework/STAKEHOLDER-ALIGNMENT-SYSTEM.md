_# Street Legends: Stakeholder Alignment & Contracting System

**Author:** Brandy Bianchini  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Purpose:** To provide a standardized system for onboarding, communicating with, and contracting all stakeholders for the Street Legends project, ensuring transparency and legal integrity.

---

## 1. Guiding Principle: Clarity and Reality

Our primary goal is to correct any misinformation and establish a single source of truth for all project stakeholders. All prior informal communications are superseded by the formal process outlined in this document. We will operate with full transparency, ensuring every stakeholder understands the project's actual status, their role, and the requirements for participation.

## 2. The Alignment Platform: `Align`

All project-related communication, documentation, and decision-making will be managed through the **Align** software platform. Use of email, text, or verbal agreements for official matters is strictly prohibited to ensure a clear and auditable record of all interactions.

### Onboarding Process:

1.  **Import Contacts:** All 50+ potential stakeholders identified by Jimmy McNickle will be imported into a dedicated "Street Legends" room within Align.
2.  **Assign Roles:** Each contact will be provisionally tagged with a potential role (e.g., "Potential Sponsor," "Venue Contact," "Service Provider").
3.  **Send Welcome & Reality Check Message:** Once onboarded, each stakeholder will receive the standardized message below.

### Standardized Onboarding Message: "Project Reality Check"

**Subject: Invitation to Align on the Street Legends Docu-Series Project**

## 3. The Contract Package: A Suite of Formal Agreements

To ensure legal and financial integrity, a series of standardized contract templates will be used. All contracts will be managed and signed digitally within the Align/Beneflts ecosystem.

### Master Document: The Master Alignment Agreement (MAA)

*   **Purpose:** A single, overarching agreement that incorporates all other sub-agreements by reference. This document is the final, legally binding package that confirms all parties are aligned and the project is green-lit.
*   **Signatories:** Brandy Bianchini, Jimmy McNickle, and a representative from every contracted stakeholder entity.

### Contract Templates:

1.  **Sponsor/Contributor Agreement (Right of Use):**
    *   **Parties:** Organization & Sponsoring Entity.
    *   **Key Terms:** Contribution amount (cash or in-kind asset value), specific use of funds (e.g., "for Z Crew travel expenses"), branding rights (logo placement, on-screen credit), payment schedule, and acknowledgment that funds are contingent on the project proceeding.

    *   **Parties:** Organization & Venue Owner/Operator.

    *   **Key Terms:** A comprehensive, state-by-state operational plan. Defines load-in/load-out schedules, footprint/space requirements, concession operations, revenue sharing model, staffing, and insurance. This is a **constant** that dictates other logistical planning.

    A[Start: Import 50+ Contacts to Align] --> B{Send 'Reality Check' Message};
    B --> C[Schedule Discovery Calls];
    C --> D{High-Priority Stakeholder?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Negotiate Terms & Select Contract Template];
    D -- No --> F[Place in 'Future Consideration' Pool];
    E --> G[Draft & Distribute Agreement via Align/Beneflts];
    G --> H{Agreement Signed?};
    H -- Yes --> I[Incorporate into Master Alignment Agreement (MAA)];
    H -- No / Revisions --> G;
    I --> J{All Stakeholders Signed?};
    J -- Yes --> K[**Execute MAA: Project Green-Lit**];

```

This system ensures a clear, repeatable, and legally sound process for aligning all parties and launching the Street Legends project successfully._
