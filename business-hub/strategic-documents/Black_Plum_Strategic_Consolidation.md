## 1. Organizational and Legal Architecture

The organization is built upon a sophisticated legal and operational structure designed for both profitability and social impact. This dual focus is enabled by the interplay between a Low-Profit Limited Liability Company (L3C) and a private operating foundation.

| Entity | Type | Role & Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal Changemakers Series L3C** | Low-Profit Limited Liability Company | The primary operating entity, founded on December 11, 2015. Its structure allows for uncapped capital building through Program-Related Investments (PRI) and enables it to work with private foundations to create financial pathways for high-risk or non-profit projects. |
| **Eternal Autumn Trust** | Private Operating Foundation | Created in July 2025, this foundation is responsible for fulfilling the program outreach and responsibilities of the L3C, managing philanthropic initiatives and ensuring mission alignment. |
| **Black Plum Concierge Agency** | Public-Facing Brand | The primary client interface for the ecosystem, positioned as **"Your Direct Portal to Brandy Bianchini."** It functions as an executive consultancy and elite membership concierge service, applying the founder's multi-industry advising and consulting expertise to the individual needs of each client. |
| **Better World** | Program Management Entity | Oversees the management and delivery of all cause-based and needs-driven service programs, ensuring they are triggered appropriately and managed effectively. |

This structure allows the organization to operate across the **U.S., Mexico, Canada, the U.K., and the E.U.**, serving both for-profit and non-profit sectors in a symbiotic system.

## 2. The Black Plum Business Model

The business model is founded on an **integrity-first philosophy**, ensuring that services are delivered with transparency and are precisely aligned with a client's true financial capacity. This is not merely a consulting firm; it is a comprehensive support ecosystem designed to act as a "life raft" and sustainability model for founders and projects at any stage.

### 2.1. Six Pillars of Transformation

The service offerings are organized into six core pillars, representing a holistic approach to client transformation.

| Pillar | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creative & Design** | Encompasses brand identity, visual systems, interior design, and full-scale creative production (film, photography). |
| **Business Development** | Includes strategic consulting, revenue architecture, grant services, and partnership structuring. |
| **Travel & Events** | Offers bespoke travel planning, retreat design, and high-end event production and curation. |
| **Lifestyle Services** | Covers real estate coordination, personal styling, family management, and executive systems design. |
| **Coaching & Counsel** | Provides executive leadership coaching, organizational training, and strategic policy development. |
| **Infrastructure & Systems** | Focuses on proprietary systems development, tailored process architecture, and in-house modeling. |

### 2.2. Proprietary Systems & Tools

A key differentiator for Black Plum is its suite of proprietary systems that structure its service delivery and strategic deployment.

- **RAPID Phase Plan:** A project lifecycle methodology (**R**esearch, **A**rchitecture, **P**lanning, **I**mplementation, **D**elivery) that ensures comprehensive and structured project execution.
- **RFFS (Rapid Financial Fiscal Solutions):** A financial advisory program that aligns service offerings with a client's actual capacity by assessing both cost of living and cost of business.
- **GRID (Global Responsible Integrated Development Tool):** A strategic deployment tool for placing projects, events, and assets across geographic jurisdictions, with a minimum of 16 cells per state.
- **Beneflts Platform:** A proprietary booking and service delivery platform (spelled B-E-N-E-F-L-T-S) for white-glove service, financing, and pre-approval of preferred clients.

### 2.3. Membership & Service Delivery

Access to the ecosystem is primarily membership-based, with tiered levels of engagement designed to match client needs and financial capacity. The intake process is rigorous, involving a comprehensive financial and needs assessment to ensure a perfect fit between the client and the services provided. Services are then delivered in a phased, "earned and raised" model, where additional services are integrated as the client's capacity and needs evolve.

| Membership Tier | Monthly Investment | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | $500 - $1,000 | Monthly consultation, email support, resource library, community access. |
| **Premium** | $1,500 - $3,000 | Priority consultation, dedicated support, strategic planning, VIP events. |
| **Elite** | $3,000+ | 24/7 concierge-level service, white-glove treatment, custom solutions. |

## 3. Programmatic & Content Strategy

All activities are structured through a formal programmatic framework, ensuring that the organization's mission is executed systematically. This program structure also dictates the content production schedule.

### 3.1. Core Program Requirements

Under the management of the **Better World** entity, a minimum of **four core programs** must be active, with each conducting at least **four events or projects annually**. This creates a baseline of 16 major activities per year, which in turn drives the content and production schedule. All programs must be **100% PRI (Program-Related Investment) and DAF (Donor Advised Fund) ready**, with both public and private-facing components.

### 3.2. Content Production

Monthly content creation is required to support mission activities, encourage community onboarding, and recruit service providers. The content, including **documentation, audio clips, and rationale**, must be easily digestible and provide a quick understanding of the organization's purpose, the founder's journey, and the types of help needed (participation and contribution).

## 4. Technical Infrastructure & Integration Roadmap

The existing repository includes a foundational website and brand assets. The next phase requires significant technical integration to bring the full vision to life. The following table outlines the priority of these integrations.

| Priority | System/Integration | Objective | Key Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Beneflts Platform** | Integrate the proprietary booking, financing, and pre-approval system into the main website. | API documentation, payment gateway selection. |
| **2** | **RingCentral API** | Automate phone routing with timezone alignment and field agent distribution for seamless intake. | Field agent recruitment, calendar system selection. |
| **3** | **Member Management CRM** | Implement a centralized CRM to track client relationships, service delivery, and financial capacity. | CRM platform selection, data migration plan. |
| **4** | **Discord Community** | Integrate the existing Discord server with the website, including single sign-on and tier management. | Discord API access, member authentication system. |
| **5** | **Bandcamp API** | Integrate a music playlist feature for members using the existing Bandcamp login and pre-purchased playlists. | Bandcamp API documentation, music licensing verification. |

## 5. Phased Implementation Plan

To bring all elements into focus, the following phased implementation plan is recommended. This roadmap provides a clear sequence of actions to build out the technical, programmatic, and operational infrastructure.

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (Months 1-3)

This phase is dedicated to building the core technical infrastructure. The priorities are the **Beneflts Platform Integration**, **RingCentral Configuration**, **CRM Setup**, and the **Discord & Bandcamp Integrations**. Success in this phase means all key systems are online and communicating, with functional user flows for booking, intake, and member engagement.

### Phase 2: Program & Content Formalization (Months 2-4)

Concurrent with technical development, this phase focuses on formalizing the programmatic structure. This involves defining the **four core programs** under the Better World entity, creating the **PRI/DAF documentation** for investors, and establishing the full **12-month event and production schedule**. By the end of this phase, the organization will have a clear, documented plan for all mission-driven activities for the upcoming year.

### Phase 3: Community Engagement & Content Launch (Months 3-6)

With the technical and programmatic foundations in place, the focus shifts to external engagement. This includes launching the **monthly content calendar**, publishing the initial suite of **mission documentation and audio clips**, and building out the **member resource library**. Critically, this phase also involves activating the **community onboarding sequence** and beginning the **recruitment of service providers and field agents** in priority jurisdictions.

### Phase 4: Geographic Expansion & Scale (Months 6-24)

This long-term phase focuses on executing the international vision. It involves deploying the **GRID tool** to strategically expand into priority jurisdictions, creating **jurisdiction-specific contract templates**, and establishing the **field agent network**. Success will be measured by the establishment of a functional presence in all target regions and the full integration of the sister brands (Luna's Garden, Global Artist Alliance, Moonlit Studio) into a unified, scalable ecosystem.
