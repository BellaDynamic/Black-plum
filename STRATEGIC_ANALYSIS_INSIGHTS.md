## Critical Gaps & Recommendations

### 1. Program Naming & Specification
**Gap:** The 4 Global programs are referenced but not specifically named in the plan.  
**Recommendation:** Define and document the specific names and detailed requirements for each program to enable accurate platform configuration.

### 2. API Integration Technical Specifications
**Gap:** The plan outlines data flow but lacks specific API integration technical requirements.  
**Recommendation:** Conduct technical discovery with each platform to document:
- API authentication methods
- Data field mapping requirements
- Sync frequency and real-time vs. batch processing
- Error handling and data validation protocols

### 3. Volunteer Recruitment Launch Readiness
**Gap:** Galaxy Digital is marked as urgent but lacks specific volunteer recruitment materials.  
**Recommendation:** Develop immediately:
- Volunteer role descriptions for each of the 6 required roles
- Application and screening process
- Training and onboarding materials
- Volunteer management policies

### 4. DENEFITS White Labeling Specifications
**Gap:** DENEFITS is confirmed for "financing & white labeling" but white labeling scope is undefined.  
**Recommendation:** Clarify white labeling requirements:
- Branding specifications (Black Plum, Bella Dynamic, etc.)
- Client-facing interface customization
- Payment portal integration with website

### 5. Multi-Entity Accounting Separation
**Gap:** Odoo must manage separate accounting for L3C and Foundation but separation protocols are not detailed.  
**Recommendation:** Define accounting separation requirements:
- Chart of accounts structure for each entity
- Inter-entity transaction protocols
- Reporting requirements for each entity type
- Compliance and audit trail requirements

### 6. Data Privacy & Security Protocols
**Gap:** No mention of data privacy, security, or compliance requirements across platforms.  
**Recommendation:** Establish immediately:
- Data privacy policies for client and volunteer information
- Platform security requirements and access controls
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA if applicable)
- Data backup and disaster recovery protocols

### 7. Platform Training & Documentation
**Gap:** Staff training is mentioned for month-end but no training materials or documentation plan exists.  
**Recommendation:** Develop comprehensive training program:
- Platform-specific training modules
- Workflow documentation for each operational process
- Quick reference guides for volunteers and staff
- Ongoing support and troubleshooting resources
