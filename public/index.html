        <div class="founder-note">
            My journey to creating Black Plum began with understanding that protection and empowerment are not opposing forces, but complementary aspects of true service. Growing up in a family where advocacy was a way of life, I learned early that the most profound transformations occur when someone truly has your back. This perspective shaped my approach to every professional engagement—from crisis response leadership that saved organizations millions, to wellness programs that restored executives' health and performance, to government contracts that opened new possibilities for growth. Each success reinforced the same truth: when you combine strategic excellence with genuine care, extraordinary outcomes become possible.
